Canvas prints and oil paintings can both transform a room—but they differ in **texture**, **longevity**, and **price**.

## Quick differences
- **Oil paintings**: hand-painted, unique texture, higher price, long-term value.
- **Canvas prints**: machine-printed, consistent quality, budget-friendly, wide variety.

## Recommendation
If you want affordable décor that’s easy to hang, start with **canvas prints**. If you want a unique, heirloom-grade piece, choose **oil paintings**.
