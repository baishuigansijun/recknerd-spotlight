Hanging art well is about **stability**, **sightlines**, and **safety**. A piece can be beautiful, but if it’s too high, crooked, or insecurely hung, it distracts instead of enhancing the room.

## Three Golden Rules

**Always use two hooks for stability**
- Two points of support keep the frame from shifting each time you dust, walk past, or adjust furniture.
- Space hooks apart by about **¼ to ⅓ of the artwork’s width** for balance.

**Center at eye level — ~57 in (145 cm)**
- Museums use the “57-inch rule”: the midpoint of the artwork should be ~57 inches from the floor, matching average human eye height.
- For rooms where people are mostly seated (like dining rooms or lounges), consider lowering the center to **50–54 in (127–137 cm)** for comfort.

**Use the right hardware for weight**
- **Lightweight prints (<10 lbs / 4.5 kg):** regular nails or picture hooks are fine.
- **Medium works (10–30 lbs / 4.5–13.5 kg):** use wall anchors or heavy-duty hooks.
- **Heavy pieces (>30 lbs / 13.5 kg):** opt for French cleats, metal brackets, or professional installation.

## Framing Tips

- **Thin black or white frames** → Modern, minimal style. Great for photography and abstract prints.
- **Natural wood frames** → Warm, organic feel; pairs well with landscapes or casual décor.
- **Ornate gold or carved frames** → Classic, traditional atmosphere; works with oil paintings or historic reproductions.
- Match **visual weight**: a bold abstract canvas can handle a chunky frame, while delicate line art looks better in something slim.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Hanging too high:** One of the most frequent errors. Remember: art should connect with the furniture, not “float” a foot above it.
- **Single nail for large works:** Leads to tilting, gaps, and risk of falling. Always double up.
- **Ignoring wall type:** Drywall, brick, and plaster all require different hardware—don’t assume one method fits all.
- **Crowding pieces too tightly:** Leave breathing room (2–6 inches) between frames for a clean gallery look.

## Room-by-Room Suggestions

- **Living Room:** Center artwork above sofas or fireplaces, aligning the midpoint at eye level relative to seated height.
- **Dining Room:** Lower placement (around 50–54 in) so art is easy to enjoy while sitting.
- **Bedroom:** Keep art above headboards proportionate—typically no wider than the bed frame, hung 6–10 in above.
- **Hallways:** Use gallery-style arrangements (linear or grid) at consistent eye level for visual rhythm.
- **Kids’ Rooms:** Lower placement so children can also engage with the art safely.

## Safety Notes

- For **glass-fronted frames**, avoid hanging directly above beds or cribs.
- Use **museum putty or frame bumpers** to keep art flush to the wall and prevent shifting.
- Always check weight limits on hooks and anchors—better to overspec than risk damage.

## Quick Takeaway

Hanging art is part design, part engineering. **Stable hardware + eye-level alignment + proper frame choice** ensures your art looks intentional, safe, and timeless.
