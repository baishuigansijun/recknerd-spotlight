Hanging art well is about **stability** and **sightlines**.

## Three rules
1. Use **two hooks** for stability.
2. Center at **eye level** — roughly **57 in (145 cm)** from the floor to artwork center.
3. For heavy pieces, use **wall anchors** or professional mounting systems.

## Framing tips
Thin black frames feel modern; ornate frames read classic. Match the frame’s visual weight to the artwork and room style.
